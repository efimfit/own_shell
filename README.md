```

📄 Fork
The Fork system call is used to create a new process called a child process that runs simultaneously with the process that makes the fork () call (the parent process). After creating a new child process, both processes will execute the following statement after the fork () system call. The child process uses the same computer (program counter), the same CPU registers, and the same open files that are used in the parent process.

It does not accept parameters and returns an integer value. The various values returned by fork () are shown below.

Negative value: creating a child process failed. Zero: returned to the newly created child process. A positive value is returned to the parent or to the subscriber. This value contains the process ID of the newly created child process.
